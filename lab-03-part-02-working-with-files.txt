==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------

The cat command wrote out all of the paragraphs of the text file

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

$ head books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------

$ tail books/other/pg1232.txt
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------

$ less books/other/pg1232.txt
Spacebar allowed me to move down a whole page at a time. q allwoed me to quit the scrolling mechanisms completely. 

When I tried to use the "more" command on its own, I was getting the error "$ more books/other/pg1232.txt
bash: more: command not found." When I used "more" while the "less" command was active, I was able to scroll up line by line.

==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------

less & more - when I'd like to view a large document but skim and read through rather quickly
cat - when I need to read a shorter document in its entirety
tail - when I need to see the information about a file (ie its source)
head- when I only need to see the beginning and the title of a file
